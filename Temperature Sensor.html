        <p><i>
            Temperature sensors are devices that detect and measure coldness and heat and convert it into an electrical signal. Temperature sensors are utilized in our daily lives, <br>
            be it in the form of domestic water heaters, thermometers, refrigerators, or microwaves. There is a wide range of applications of temperature sensors, including the geotechnical monitoring field. <br>

        <h3><b> What do Temperature Sensors do? </b></h3>
        <p>    
            Temperature sensors are devices designed for measuring the degree of coolness and hotness in an object. The voltage across the diode determines the working of a temperature meter. <br>
            The change of temperature varies directly proportional to the diode's resistance. The cooler the temperature, the lesser the resistance will be and vice-versa. <br>
            A measurement of the resistance across the diode is done, and the measurement is converted into units of temperature that are readable and displayed in numeric form over readout units. <br>
            In the field of geotechnical monitoring, these temperature sensors are utilized in the measuring of internal temperatures of structures such as dams, bridges, power plants. <br>

        <h3><b> Uses of Temperature Sensors </b></h3>
        <p>
            There are many different types of temperature sensors, but the most common way that is used in their categorization is based on the mode of connection that includes contact and non-contact temperature sensors. <br>
            Examples of contact sensors include thermistors and thermocouples because their contact with the objects they measure is direct, whereas non-contact type temperature sensors measure the heat source's radiation. <br> 
            Such temperature meters are mostly used in hazardous environments such as thermal power plants or nuclear power plants. Temperature sensors are used to measure the hydration heat in mass concrete structures, <br>
            in the field of geotechnical monitoring. They can also be utilized to monitor the migration of seepage or groundwater. <br>
            One area where they are commonly used is in curing concrete since the concrete has to be relatively warm to properly set and cure. <br>
            The variations of seasons causes expansion or contraction of structures, bringing an overall change to their volume. <br>

        <h3><b> How Temperature Sensors Work </b></h3>
        <p>
            The working principle of a temperature sensor is the voltage across the terminals of the diode. If there is an increase in the voltage, the temperature also increases. <br>
            This is followed by a drop in the voltage between the terminals of the transistor of base and emitter in a diode. There are also temperature sensors that work on the principle of stress change caused by changes in temperature. <br> 
            In a vibrating wire temperature meter, dissimilar metals have different linear coefficients of expansion. <br>
            It mainly consists of a magnetic stretched wire of high tensile strength with two ends fixed to any dissimilar metal so that any temperature change will directly affect the tension in the wire and its natural vibration frequency. <br> 
            The dissimilar metal can be made from aluminum since it has a larger linear expansion coefficient than steel. <br>
            When the conversion of the temperature signal into frequency occurs, the very same read-out unit that is used for other vibrating wire sensors can also be utilized in the monitoring of temperature also. <br>
            The specially built vibrating wire sensor is the one that senses the temperature change and then the temperature change is converted into an electrical signal which is then transmitted to the read out the unit as a frequency. <br>
