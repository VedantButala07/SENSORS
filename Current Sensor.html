            Have you ever stopped and wonder the amount of current each of your electrical appliances require? <br>
            Well, it's a tedious process to know it all but that's where the functionality of a current sensor comes to play. <br>
            With different devices having different current requirements, if a wrong amount of current is fed to them, it may result in severe circumstances (overloading, etc.). <br>
            Hence, it's necessary for one to monitor the required current for applications, <br>
            and that's when people turn to a current sensor to do the job, notably the ACS712 AC/DC Current sensor. <br>

            The ACS712 is a fully integrated, hall effect-based linear current sensor with 2.1kVRMS voltage isolation and a integrated low-resistance current conductor. <br>
            Technical terms aside, it's simply put forth as a current sensor that uses its conductor to calculate and measure the amount of current applied. <br>
            <h3><b> The features of ACS712 include : </b></h3>
            <ul>
            1. 80kHz bandwith <br>
            2. 66 to 185 mV/A output sensitivity <br>
            3. Low-noise analog signal path <br>
            4. Device bandwith is set via the new FILTER pin <br>
            5. 1.2 mΩ internal conductor resistance <br>
            6. Total output error of 1.5% at TA = 25°C <br>
            7. Stable output offset voltage <br>
            8. Near zero magnetic hysteresis <br>
        </ul></p>

            The ACS712 current sensor uses indirect sensing to measure current. This means that it does not directly measure the current flowing through it, but instead measures the magnetic field generated by the current. <br>
            The ACS712 has an onboard Hall sensor circuit, which detects the magnetic field and generates a voltage proportional to its strength. <br>
            This voltage is then used to measure the amount of current flowing through the sensor. In simplified terms, the ACS712 works as follows : <br> 
            Current flows through the onboard Hall sensor circuit in the IC. The Hall effect sensor detects the incoming current through its magnetic field generation. <br>
            Once detected, the Hall effect sensor generates a voltage proportional to its magnetic field that is then used to measure the amount of current. <br> 
            The ACS712 is a versatile and accurate current sensor that can be used in a variety of applications, such as motor control, battery monitoring, and power management. <br>

            The ACS712 current sensor can be connected to your Arduino board through a series of jumper wires connections based on its pinout. <br>
            However, here at Seeed, we understand the complications and complexity of doing so. <br>
            Hence, we've decided to provide a tutorial for our Grove ±5A DC/AC Current Sensor (ACS70331) to display how easy our Grove plug-and-play system is! <br> 
            <h3><b> Hardware Assembly : </b></h3>
            Step 1: Connect Grove - ±5A DC/AC Current Sensor (ACS70331) to port A0 of the Grove - Base Shield <br>
            Step 2: Connect the positive and negative poles of the circuit to be tested <br>
            to the corresponding positive and negative poles of the screw terminal <br>
            Step 3: Plug Grove - Base Shield into Seeeduino <br>
            Step 4: Connect Seeeduino to PC via a USB cable <br><br>
            Although the ACS712 is a known option when it comes to current sensor modules for Arduino usage, <br>
            its performance disadvantages as compared to our alternatives here at Seeed are factors to consider! <br>
