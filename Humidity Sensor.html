            Sometimes, after rain, the air feels moist. The water seems to have suspended in the air. However, in certain AC's you click some buttons and the atmosphere brightens up. How and why does it all happen? <br>
            Moisture forms up in the air, resulting in humidity. However, the humidity sensor in your AC picks it up and cleans it up for you. Isn't that wonderful? Let's take a look at how it does that. <br>
            A humidity sensor (or hygrometer) senses, measures, and reports both moisture and air temperature. The ratio of moisture in the air to the highest amount of moisture at a particular air temperature is called relative humidity. <br>
            Relative humidity becomes an important factor when looking for comfort. <br>
        </i></p>
        <p>
            Humidity sensors work by detecting changes that alter electrical currents or temperature in the air. <br>
            There are three basic types of humidity sensors : <br>
            1. Capacitive   2. Resistive    3. Thermal <br>
            All three types of sensors monitor minute changes in the atmosphere in order to calculate the humidity in the air. <br>
        </p>
        <h3><b> Capacitive </b></h3>
        <p>
            A capacitive humidity sensor measures relative humidity by placing a thin strip of metal oxide between two electrodes. <br>
            The metal oxide's electrical capacity changes with the atmosphere's relative humidity. Weather, commercial and industries are the major application areas. <br>
            The capacitive type sensors are linear and can measure relative humidity from 0% to 100%. The catch here is a complex circuit and regular calibration. <br>
            However, for designers this a lesser hassle over precise measurement and hence these dominate atmospheric and process measurements. <br>
            These are the only types of full-range relative humidity measuring devices down to 0% relative humidity. This low-temperature effect often leads to them being used over wide temperature ranges without active temperature compensation. <br>

        <h3><b> Resistive </b></h3>
        <p>
            Resistive humidity sensors utilize ions in salts to measure the electrical impedance of atoms. As humidity changes, so do the resistance of the electrodes on either side of the salt medium. <br>
        </p>
        <h3><b> Thermal </b></h3>
        <p>
            Two thermal sensors conduct electricity based upon the humidity of the surrounding air. One sensor is encased in dry nitrogen while the other measures ambient air. The difference between the two measures the humidity. <br>

        <h3><b> DHT-11 </b></h3>
        <p>
            DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor features a temperature & humidity sensor <br>
            complex with a calibrated digital signal output. By using the exclusive digital-signal-acquisition <br>
            technique and temperature & humidity sensing technology, it ensures high reliability and <br>
            excellent long-term stability. This sensor includes a resistive-type humidity measurement <br>
            component and an NTC temperature measurement component, and connects to a highperformance 8-bit microcontroller, <br>
            offering excellent quality, fast response, anti-interference ability and cost-effectiveness. <br>

        <h3><b> APPLICATIONS </b></h3>
        <p><i>
            The applications of humidity sensor range far and wide. People with illnesses affected by humidity, monitoring and preventive measure in homes employ humidity sensors. <br>
            A humidity sensor is also found as part of home heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems (HVAC systems). <br>
            These are also used in offices, cars, humidors, museums, industrial spaces and greenhouses and are also used in meteorology stations to report and predict the weather. <br>
